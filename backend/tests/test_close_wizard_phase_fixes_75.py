"""
Backend tests for Close Wizard Phase 1-4 Fixes (Iteration 75):
- Daily-log API with by_payment_method breakdown
- Close preview with expenses grouped
- Multi-day unclosed days detection
- Credit invoices with item breakdown

Tests verify comprehensive data for all wizard steps:
Step 1: Sales Log - ALL payment methods (cash, gcash, maya, split, credit)
Step 2: Customer Credits - Per-invoice item breakdown with payment status
Step 4: Expenses - Grouped by category
Step 5: Actual Count - E-wallet payments breakdown
Step 7: Z-Report - Cash Drawer Reconciliation
