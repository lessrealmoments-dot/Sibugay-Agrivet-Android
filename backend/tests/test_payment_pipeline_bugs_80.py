Test Payment Pipeline Bug Fixes - Iteration 80
Tests 7 bugs across daily close preview, sales history search, AR payments, and void functionality.

Bugs tested:
BUG 1: GET /api/daily-close-preview should exclude voided sales_log entries from cash totals
BUG 2: GET /api/daily-close-preview should exclude voided expenses from expense totals
BUG 3: GET /api/invoices/history/by-date with search param should still filter by date
BUG 4: POST /api/receivables/{id}/payment with method=GCash should update digital wallet
BUG 5: POST /api/invoices should include payment_type field in created invoice
BUG 6: POST /api/invoices/{id}/void should reverse ALL payment records from correct wallets
BUG 7: POST /api/customers/{id}/receive-payment with method=GCash should route to digital wallet
