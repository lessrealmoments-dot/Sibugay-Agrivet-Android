# AgriBooks Changelog

## Mar 31, 2026 — Modal Consolidation Phase 1 + Modal Registry PDF
- **Modal Registry PDF** generated — catalogs all 23 modal/dialog components with screenshots, groups (A-G), redundancy map, quick reference. Saved to R2 at `agribooks-docs/reports/modal-registry-2026-03/`
- **Phase 1:** ReviewDetailDialog (A1) absorbs PODetailModal (A3). Added backward-compat props: `poId`, `poNumber`, `onUpdated`, `onOpenChange`. Resolution: `poNumber` → `/invoices/by-number` → UUID → `/dashboard/review-detail`
- **7 pages migrated:** CloseWizardPage, PaySupplierPage, QuickSearch, AuditCenterPage, SuppliersPage, TransactionSearchPage, DashboardPage — all use ReviewDetailDialog now
- PODetailModal.js now has zero imports (orphaned)

## Mar 31, 2026 — Security Alert Enrichment (Phases 1-3)
- **Phase 1:** Authenticated PIN alerts enriched with user_role, user_email, branch_name. New message: "Manager (Manager) entered wrong PIN 6x at Branch 1 — Action: Context"
- **Phase 2:** QR brute-force alerts replaced "Unknown IP" with "AgriSmart Terminal at Branch X". Full doc enrichment (doc_number, counterparty, amount, doc_id). terminal_id passed through all 3 QR action call sites
- **Phase 3:** SecurityAlertDetail expandable card in NotificationsPage — WHO+WHAT cards (auth) / TERMINAL+DOCUMENT cards (QR). Clickable doc number opens ReviewDetailDialog. Lock banner for locked docs. "View Receipt" button for authenticated PIN alerts with linked doc
- Tested: 28/28 backend, 11/11 frontend (iteration_145.json)

## Mar 31, 2026 — Compliance Deadline Notifications (Phase 5)
- APScheduler daily job at 8:30 AM fires compliance_deadline notifications
- Covers: expired docs (critical), expiring within 30d (warning), missing monthly filings after 15th
- Dedup via metadata.dedup_key. `create_notification()` extended with severity_override param
- Frontend: compliance_deadline type with orange FileWarning icon + ComplianceDetail expandable row
- Tested: 22/23 backend, 100% frontend (iteration_144.json)

## Mar 12, 2026 — Inline Interest Rate Override
- Added editable interest rate input in Receive Payments charges section
- Pre-fills with customer's saved rate; allows override for customers with no rate
- "Save to customer profile" checkbox when rate differs from saved
- Backend `generate-interest` + `charges-preview` accept `rate_override` param
- Interest formula: `principal × (rate/100/30) × days from last_interest_date` (prevents double-charging)
- Testing: 9/9 backend + all frontend UI tests passed

## Mar 12, 2026 — QB-Style Receive Payments Redesign + Discount Feature
- **Redesigned** PaymentsPage.js to match QuickBooks "Customer Payment" layout:
  - Inline customer search with balance display on top-right
  - Payment method as icon buttons (Cash, Check, Bank, GCash, Maya)
  - Invoice table with QB columns: Date, Number, Type, Orig. Amt, Amt. Due, Discount, Payment + Totals row
  - "Amounts for Selected Invoices" summary panel (Amount Due, Applied, Discount, Remaining)
  - Memo + Save & Apply / Clear at bottom
- **Added Discount on Interest/Penalty**: Per-invoice discount input with % and fixed amount toggle
  - Backend records discounts as `method: "Discount"` payment entries (no wallet impact, audit trail)
  - Only available on interest_charge and penalty_charge invoice types
- Testing: 32/32 frontend + 9/10 backend tests passed

## Mar 12, 2026 — Close Wizard "Find & Pay" Panel Fix + Enhancement
- **Fixed 3 bugs** in CloseWizardPage.js Step 3 "Receive payment for a customer (not listed above)" panel:
  1. `overflow-hidden` CSS on container clipped the customer search dropdown
  2. Wrong API endpoint: `/invoices?status=open` → `/customers/{id}/invoices` (now includes "partial" status invoices)
  3. Field name mismatch: dialog expected `remaining_balance` but invoices have `balance`
- **Enhanced** panel into full mini-PaymentsPage:
  - Multi-invoice per-row payment allocation
  - Interest generation (uses customer's configured rate)
  - Penalty generation with configurable percentage
  - Quick total input + "Pay All" auto-apply button
  - Uses proper `/customers/{id}/receive-payment` endpoint for multi-allocation
  - Wizard data auto-refreshes after payment so AR table updates immediately
- Testing: 10/10 frontend tests passed

## Mar 11, 2026 — Critical Accounting Fixes
- Fixed `is_digital_payment` helper: "Partial" and "Split" payments no longer classified as digital
- Fixed starting float calculation for first-ever daily close
- Fixed Sales Log running totals: digital payments and split sale totals now correct
- Created and ran data migration endpoints to fix corrupted invoice + wallet balances
- Established agent communication protocol: explain before coding, ask before creating new modules

## Earlier — Various Bug Fixes
- Checkout payment type tabs fix (Split/Partial/Credit)
- Receipt upload QR code visibility
- Partial payment closing wizard decomposition
- autoComplete fix (48 instances)
- PIN verification audit (all endpoints connected)
