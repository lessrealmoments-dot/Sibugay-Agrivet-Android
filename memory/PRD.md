## What's Been Implemented

### QR Security Hardening (2026-03-17) — Complete
- **Gap 1 fixed:** PIN brute-force lockout per doc_code. 5 failures → admin alert; 10 failures → 15-min 429 lockout. Auto-resets on success.
- **Gap 2 fixed:** `receive_payment` and `transfer_receive` now require idempotency UUID (`payment_ref`, `transfer_ref`) — duplicate submissions rejected with 409.
- **Gap 3 fixed:** Every QR payment now writes a double-entry journal record (Debit Cash/Digital, Credit AR).
- **Gap 4 fixed:** `client_ip` and `user_agent` captured on every `qr_action_log` entry.
- **Gap 5 fixed:** `DocViewerPage.jsx` shows attempts-remaining warning (≤4 left) and a live countdown banner when locked.
- New functions in `utils/security.py`: `check_qr_lockout`, `log_failed_qr_pin_attempt`, `log_successful_qr_pin_attempt`, `_raise_qr_security_alert`.


- Multi-tenant org management, branch management, user roles & permissions
- Unified sales: walk-in, credit, partial, digital, split payments
- Purchase orders (external suppliers only), suppliers, branch transfers
- Inventory management, count sheets, barcode printing
- Customers, price schemes, branch-specific pricing
- Daily operations, close-of-day wizard, Z-reports
- Payments, fund management, expenses, accounting, journal entries
- Audit center, incident tickets, backups, reports
- Mobile barcode scanner, returns/refunds

### AgriSmart Terminal (Complete — Mar 2026)
- Device pairing (6-char code + QR auto-pair)
- Terminal Shell with floating mode selector (Sales | PO Check | Transfers | Settings)
- Sales with barcode scanner, full checkout, print order slip
- PO verification + Transfer receive with variance handling
- WebSocket real-time notifications, Terminal Pull

### Terminal Smart QR Scan + Branch Security (2026-03-17) — Complete
- **BUG FIX:** QR pair token no longer hardcodes "admin" role — uses actual initiating user's role
- **BUG FIX:** `pull-po` and `pull-transfer` PIN are now branch-restricted (manager PINs only work for their branch)
- **BUG FIX:** Blank receipt reprint from DocViewer fixed — now uses `PrintEngine` with proper 58mm thermal + full-page format instead of `window.print()` on raw HTML
- **NEW:** `terminal_pull` and `qr_cross_branch_action` added to `PIN_POLICY_ACTIONS`; `qr_cross_branch_action` is TOTP-only (no static manager PIN allowed cross-branch)
- **NEW:** `GET /api/doc/search?q=...&branch_id=...` endpoint — branch-scoped search by invoice number, PO number, or transfer order number; returns `doc_code` for navigation
- **NEW:** Global H10P HID keyboard wedge scanner in `TerminalShell` — detects doc codes (8-char alphanumeric), URLs containing doc codes, `agrismart://` deeplinks, and invoice numbers from hardware scanner input; routes to correct action across all tabs
- **NEW:** Smart doc search in terminal header — accepts invoice/PO/transfer numbers, shows dropdown of matching results with doc codes
- **NEW:** DocViewerPage cross-branch enforcement — when `?branch=` param doesn't match doc's branch, shows TOTP-only unlock gate; after TOTP verification, actions are unlocked with audit trail
- **NEW:** Terminal navigation to `/doc/` always passes `?branch=session.branchId` for proper cross-branch detection

### Capacitor APK Wrapper + H10P Printer SDK (2026-03-18) — Complete
- **Capacitor setup**: `@capacitor/core@6` + `@capacitor/android@6` installed, `capacitor.config.ts` created in live-URL mode (always loads `https://agri-books.com`, no APK rebuild for web updates)
- **Android project generated**: `frontend/android/` — full Capacitor Android project structure
- **H10P Printer AIDL files**: `PrinterInterface.aidl`, `PSAMCallback.aidl`, `PSAMData.aidl` placed in correct AIDL directory (`recieptservice.com.recieptservice` package)
- **Native plugin**: `H10PPrinterPlugin.java` — binds to `recieptservice.com.recieptservice.service.PrinterService`, renders HTML→Bitmap via headless WebView, calls `printer.beginWork()` → `printer.printBitmap(bitmap)` → `printer.endWork()`
- **PrintBridge.js**: environment-aware router — detects `Capacitor.isNativePlatform()`, routes to SDK on H10P or `window.print()` on browser
- **H10PPrinterPlugin.js**: Capacitor JS interface with web browser fallback
- **PrintEngine.js**: added `generateHtml()` method (returns HTML without print script, used by PrintBridge for native path)
- **Terminal print call sites updated**: `TerminalSales.jsx`, `TerminalShell.jsx`, `DocViewerPage.jsx` — all use `PrintBridge.print()` instead of `PrintEngine.print()`
- **PWA manifest updated**: `start_url: /terminal`, `orientation: portrait` — ready for "Add to Home Screen"
- **Build guide**: `frontend/ANDROID_BUILD_GUIDE.md` — complete step-by-step APK build instructions
- **AAR placeholder**: `android/app/libs/README.txt` — user must copy `printer-release.aar` here before building
- When the H10P Newland scanner reads a document QR code, a bottom sheet appears INSTANTLY
- Shows: doc number, customer/supplier, amount, status, item count
- **Three actions:** [Print 58mm Thermal] [Print Full Page] [View / Take Action]
- Reprint happens directly without navigating away — no PIN needed for reprinting
- Uses `PrintEngine` with `basicDocToPrintData()` transformer to map public doc view fields to PrintEngine format
- Falls back to doc viewer navigation if doc not found

### QR Document Lookup System (Complete — Mar 2026)
- Unique 8-char doc code per document, QR on every receipt
- 3-Tier Access Model (Open / PIN / Terminal)
- Document code scanning in Ctrl+K QuickSearch
- `/doc` entry page (type code manually if QR faded)
- `/doc/:code` full action page

### PrintEngine v2 (Complete — Mar 2026)
- Professional template with QR codes on all document types

- PIN-based authorization for resolving incidents
- Audit Center + Incident Tickets merged for single source of truth

### QR Operational Workflows — Phase 1 (Complete — Mar 2026)
- `release_mode: "full" | "partial"` on invoices
- `inventory.quantity` = available. `inventory.reserved_qty` = customer's stock pending pickup.
- Physical on shelf = quantity + reserved_qty (always accurate)
- `sale_reservations` collection for delivery tracking

- `POST /api/qr-actions/{code}/verify_pin` — unlock panel without action
- `StockReleaseManager` in `DocViewerPage.jsx` — unified PIN-gated panel: history + form + confirmation
- 30-day expiry APScheduler job → `expiry_return` movement, manager notification
- Void guard for partial-release invoices (only reverses unreleased portion)
- Auto doc_code generated at partial-release sale creation (returned in response)

### Count Sheets — Reserved Stock Fix (Complete — Mar 2026)
- `system_quantity = quantity + reserved_qty` (total physical on shelf)
- Adjustment: `new_quantity = actual_counted - reserved_qty` (reserved untouched)
- UI shows "80 avail + 20 reserved" breakdown

### Pending Releases Page (Complete — Mar 2026)

- `ReceivePaymentPanel` inside Tier 2 of DocViewerPage.jsx (reuses Tier 2 unlock PIN)
- Reflects in Z-report and payment history automatically

### QR Operational Workflows — Phase 4 (Complete — Mar 2026)
- `POST /api/qr-actions/{code}/transfer_receive` — PIN-gated, delegates to `receive_transfer()` with synthetic user
- Exact match → inventory moves immediately (status: received). Variance → received_pending, source branch notified
- `TransferReceivePanel` in DocViewerPage.jsx — locked → PIN → qty inputs → confirm → done
- `verify_pin` endpoint made generic (works for both invoice and branch_transfer)
- Branch transfer items in open view now include `product_id`

### QR Operational Workflows — Phase 5 (Complete — Mar 2026)
- Terminal Doc Code Entry: Search icon in TerminalShell header → type code → navigate to /doc/{code}

### Branch Transfer Security Fixes (Complete — Mar 2026)
- View modal: "Confirm Receipt" only shows for destination branch (sender cannot see it)
- View modal: "Verify" button restricted to admin/auditor only
- Backend: `receive_transfer()` now guards against non-destination-branch users (403)

### admin_totp Removed (Complete — Mar 2026)
- Merged into standard `totp` method. Removed from PIN_METHODS, QR policy defaults updated.

### PO Bug Fix (Complete — Mar 2026)
- `setSourceType`/`setSupplyBranchId`/`setShowRetailToggle` missing useState declarations added to PurchaseOrderPage.js

### Sales Order Redesign & Security Hardening (Complete — Mar 2026)
- **UI Redesign:** Order mode form in `UnifiedSalesPage.js` matches inFlow layout
- **Date as Single Source of Truth:** Removed `invoice_date`, `order_date` is sole controller for reports
- **Timezone Fix:** Default date uses browser's local time (PHT), not UTC
- **Synchronized Date UI:** Sale Date field and Unclosed Days banner are perfectly synced
- **Closed-Day Guard:** Frontend + backend block sales on formally closed days (Z-report finalized)
- **Floor-Date Guard (System Start):** Backend rejects dates before the branch's earliest operational date. Frontend `min` attribute on date input.
- **Collapsible Order Header:** Customer Details & Order Info section is collapsible (collapsed by default)
- **Sale Date moved to top bar:** Always visible next to Customer PO, not buried in collapsible section
- **Editable Customer Info:** Contact/Phone and Billing Address editable when customer selected. Pre-checkout save dialog.
- **Quick↔Order Mode Transfer:** Cart items seamlessly transfer between modes. Order→Quick blocked if per-line discounts exist.

### Discount & Price Override Audit System — Phase 1 (Complete — Mar 2026)
- **Permission enforcement: `sales.give_discount`** — Backend rejects discounts from users without permission. Frontend disables discount fields + price editing.
- **Permission enforcement: `sales.sell_below_cost`** — Capital guard now permission-gated. Users WITH permission can override; users WITHOUT are blocked.
- **Discount-below-capital guard** — Frontend + backend block discounts that push net price per unit below capital.
- **Audit trail: `discount_audit_log` collection** — Every sale with discounts or price overrides is logged with full detail (who, what, how much, which items).
- **Reports: Discounts tab** — New tab in /reports with date/branch/group-by filters. Shows total discounts, price overrides, by customer or employee, with drill-down detail.

### Permission Enforcement Phase 2 (Complete — Mar 2026)
- **`products.view_cost`** — Cost column in Products table + Cost Price/Capital field in edit dialog hidden when OFF. Avg ₱, Last ₱, below-capital warnings in Sales page hidden when OFF.
- **`customers.view_balance`** — Balance & Credit Limit columns in Customers table hidden when OFF. Balance/Limit display in Sales page customer dropdown and checkout hidden when OFF.
- **`customers.manage_credit`** — Credit Limit, Interest Rate, Grace Period fields in Customer form disabled when OFF (separate from customers.edit).
- **`reports.export`** — Print buttons on AR Aging, Sales, Expense, and Profit report tabs hidden when OFF.
- **`reports.view_profit`** — NEW: Product Profitability Report tab in /reports. Shows revenue, cost, profit, margin per product. Sortable by profit/revenue/margin/qty. Gated behind this permission.
- **`accounting.generate_interest` / `generate_penalty`** — Remapped from `create_expense` to their own dedicated permission keys.

### Terminal QR Scanner + Camera Fix (Complete — Mar 2026)
- **QR Scanner in mode selector:** New "Scan QR" option in the floating terminal mode selector (bottom-left nudge). Opens full-screen camera scanner for document QR codes. Uses `html5-qrcode`. When a doc QR is scanned, stops camera and shows the existing QuickScan bottom sheet (print thermal/full page, view/take action). Also handles doc number patterns and product barcodes.
- **Camera scanner size fix:** Barcode camera in TerminalSales uses clipped container (140px visible window over full-res video) so it only shows the scanning strip. Full camera resolution preserved for detection.
- **Stock visibility in terminal:** Search results show color-coded stock badges (green/amber/red). Cart items show available quantity with amber highlight when exceeding stock.
- **Insufficient stock override:** Terminal now shows a proper modal (like desktop) when stock is short, with manager PIN override option. White screen crash fixed — structured error objects no longer passed to toast.

### Adaptive Incident Ticket System (Complete — Mar 2026)
- **Ticket numbering:** New tickets use `IT-{BranchCode}-{Sequence}` (e.g., `IT-B1-001000`) via standard `generate_next_number`.
- **Branch-scoped ticket list:** Admin on "All Branches" sees all tickets; specific branch shows only that branch's tickets.
- **Adaptive detail view:** Ticket detail dialog detects `ticket_type` and renders context-appropriate layout:
  - **Transfer variance:** Transfer link, route, sent/received items table, sender confirm button
  - **Negative stock override:** Product, branch, invoice, stock before/after, cashier, override approver. Investigation guide with 4 root causes.
- **New resolution types for stock tickets:** `unencoded_po`, `count_error`, `wrong_item`, `shrinkage` — each with contextual help text and appropriate journal entry generation.
- **Resolve dialog is ticket-type-aware:** Shows only relevant resolution options (stock types for stock tickets, transfer types for transfer tickets).

See `/app/memory/ROADMAP.md` for full implementation spec.

### AgriDocs — Business Document Cloud Phase 1 (Complete — Mar 2026)
- **Document management system** for Philippine business compliance documents
- **6 categories:** Business Registration, LGU/Local Permits, BIR, Employer & Employee Compliance (SSS/PhilHealth/Pag-IBIG), Industry-Specific Agrivet (BAI/FDA/FPA), Other
- **Smart period tagging:** Monthly (multi-month select for bulk payments), quarterly, annual, validity (from/to dates), one-time
- **Folder browsing UI:** Category folders -> sub-category folders -> document list with monthly grid view
- **Upload from computer:** Drag & drop, file picker, category/type/month selection
- **QR phone upload:** Generate 15-min upload token -> QR code -> phone uploads directly to correct branch/category/period
- **Document preview:** Inline PDF/image viewer, download, metadata display
- **Edit & delete:** Change coverage months, tags, validity dates anytime
- **Compliance summary API:** Which months are filed, what's expiring, what's expired
- **Audit-sensitive badges:** Agrivet documents (BAI, FDA, FPA) flagged as audit-critical
- **Expiry tracking:** Permits/licenses show days remaining with color badges
- **R2 storage:** Files in Cloudflare R2 with pre-signed URLs
- **Backend:** `routes/documents.py` (12 endpoints). Collections: `business_documents`, `doc_upload_tokens`
- **Frontend:** `pages/DocumentsPage.js` with UploadDialog, PreviewDialog, EditDialog, QRUploadDialog, MonthlyGrid
- **Phase 2 — QR Phone Upload Page:** `pages/DocUploadPage.js` at public route `/doc-upload/:token` — mobile-friendly upload (Take Photo / Browse Files), shows category/type/months context, single-use 15-min tokens, success/error states
- **Context-aware dialogs:** Upload Dialog and QR Upload Dialog auto-pre-fill category/sub-category from current folder navigation. Upload Dialog includes inline "Upload via Phone Instead" QR code generator.
- **Phase 3 — Compliance Dashboard:** Shows on root documents view with: expired document alerts (red banner), expiring soon alerts (amber, within 60 days), Monthly Filing Tracker for 6 key filings (SSS, PhilHealth, Pag-IBIG, BIR 1601-C, 0619-E, 2550M) with dot indicators (green=filed, red=missing, gray=upcoming) and X/Y progress counts. Year filter 2022-2027. Fixed branch_id='all' filter bug.
- **Terminal Document Upload:** New "Upload Doc" option in terminal floating mode selector. PIN-gated access (Manager PIN = branch-only, Admin/TOTP = all branches). 4-step flow: PIN → Category/Type/Period → Camera/Browse → Upload. Uses native phone camera via `capture="environment"`. Backend: `POST /api/documents/terminal/verify-pin` and `POST /api/documents/terminal/upload`. Frontend: `TerminalDocUpload.jsx` separate component. PIN action: `terminal_doc_upload` in verify.py.

- Added `MIN_H_MAP` / `MIN_W_MAP` constants; all layout items now carry `minH`/`minW` guards
- `validateLayouts()` sanitizes stale/corrupted `localStorage` layouts on load
- Enabled `isResizable={true}` with `se` resize handles on both Owner & Branch grids
- Fixed critical P0 bug: added getDerivedStateFromProps pattern (`prevLayoutKey` guard) so layouts reset synchronously on owner↔branch view switch — no widget collapses after branch change
- Added CSS for resize handle (bottom-right corner indicator)

### Controlled Negative Stock Override (Complete — Mar 2026)
- Hard stock block replaced with structured 422 `insufficient_stock` response listing all failing items
- `InsufficientStockModal` in `UnifiedSalesPage.js`: 3 options — Encode PO, Manager Override, Cancel
- Manager Override requires PIN (`stock_negative_override` policy: manager_pin / admin_pin / totp)
- Override passes `manager_override_pin` on retry; backend verifies PIN, skips stock guard, allows negative inventory
- Auto-creates `incident_tickets` record (`ticket_type: "negative_stock_override"`, `status: open`) per overridden item — linked to invoice, records who approved and method
- Inventory page: negative items show red "Negative — Investigate" badge with red row background
- Close Wizard Step 1: non-blocking warning banner listing negative items + link to Incident Tickets
- Count Sheets snapshot: items with negative available qty get `has_negative_stock: true` flag + "⚠ Negative — check open ticket" warning in red
- Low-stock alert endpoint: `negative_stock` status added, sorts above `out_of_stock`
- Moving average: completely unaffected (only `purchase`/`transfer_in` movements update MA)
- Offline: same as before — offline sync already allows negative with `stock_warnings`; online path now consistent


`POST /api/qr-actions/{code}/receive_payment`
- Receives cash/digital payments on invoices via QR scan
- Routes to existing wallet functions (update_cashier_wallet / update_digital_wallet)
- Updates customer AR balance
- Z-report picks up payments automatically (queries invoices.payments[])

### Phase 4 — PO Receive via QR
`POST /api/qr-actions/{code}/po_receive`
- Delegates to terminal_finalize_po() in purchase_orders.py
- Already-received POs: view-only (available_actions=[])

### Phase 5 — Transfer QR Receive
`POST /api/qr-actions/{code}/transfer_receive`
- Delegates entirely to receive_transfer() in branch_transfers.py
- Handles variance → received_pending automatically

### Phase 6 — Terminal Doc Code Entry
- Add "Find by Code" input in terminal shell header
- navigate('/doc/${code}') — no other changes needed

---

## Prioritized Backlog

### Dashboard Review Panel Enhancement (Complete — Mar 2026)
- `GET /api/dashboard/review-detail/{record_type}/{record_id}` — enriched endpoint returning full record detail for review
- Supports: purchase_order (supplier, items, dates, due date, payment status), branch_transfer (branches, items, shortage info), expense (category, payee, method)
- Review dialog now shows: full item breakdown table, receipt photos, supplier/branch info, dates, payment status
- PIN-gated "Mark as Reviewed" with optional notes, "Open Full Page" link

### Dashboard AP + Pending Reviews Fixes (Complete — Mar 2026)
- **Bug Fix:** Pending Reviews no longer shows draft/ordered/cancelled POs — filter updated to only include `received`, `fulfilled`, `partially_fulfilled`, `in_progress`, `sent_to_terminal` statuses
- **Bug Fix:** Accounts Payable widget now captures all unpaid supplier POs (not just `po_type: "terms"`/`"credit"`) — broadened to exclude only internal `branch_request` POs
- **Enhancement:** AP widget rows now show receipt review status badge (green ✓ = reviewed, amber camera = needs review)
- **Enhancement:** AP widget hint text: "Click any PO to review receipts & verify before payment" — unified workflow with Pending Reviews (both open ReviewDetailDialog)


### AP Payment + Verify Workflow — Phases 1–3 (Complete — Mar 2026)
- **Phase 1:** review-detail endpoint fixed (uses stored `balance` not grand_total — fixes ₱0 bug). Wallet balances (cashier/safe/bank/digital) returned in PO response. `1030 Cash - Bank Account` added to chart of accounts.
- **Phase 2:** ReviewDetailDialog "Verify & Approve" collapsible button — no longer gated by files. Uses `po_mark_reviewed` PIN policy. Works on AP + Pending Reviews widgets.
- **Phase 3:** Pay Now panel in ReviewDetailDialog (AP widget only). Cashier/Safe = `pay_po_standard` (manager/admin/TOTP). Bank/Digital = `pay_po_bank` (admin/TOTP only). Smart double-entry journal auto-created for bank/digital (DR: AP 2000, CR: Bank 1030 or Digital 1020). Expense record always created → Z-report + Close Wizard. Receipt upload auto-opens after payment. PaySupplierPage: PIN now required, bank/digital fund sources added, upload auto-opens, recordType fixed to "purchase_order".
- **Phase 4 (Complete — Mar 2026):** PaySupplierPage multi-PO batch receipt upload modal — after paying multiple POs, a modal lists all paid POs with individual Upload buttons, progress bar (N of M uploaded), per-PO upload tracking via UploadQRDialog, and Skip/Done controls. **Collection Receipt mode:** toggle "One receipt covers all" — upload once, system auto-shares to all POs via `POST /api/uploads/share-receipt` (creates mirror upload_session records in DB per PO, same stored_path, no R2 copy needed, `shared_from` audit trail). Files appear in Pending Reviews for each PO automatically. **Shared receipt provenance in ReviewDetailDialog:** when reviewing a PO whose receipt was shared from a collection, shows blue "Collection receipt · shared from PO-XXXX (Vendor)" notice + per-photo "Shared" badge. Backend: `review-detail` endpoint enriches file entries with `is_shared`, `shared_from_po_number`, `shared_from_vendor`, `all_receipts_shared` flag.


### Notification Center v2 (Complete — Mar 2026)
- **Phase 1 — Missing notifications added:** `discount_given` (fires on every discounted sale with full item detail + repeat-offender count), `below_cost_sale` (below-capital sale), `negative_stock_override` (after incident ticket created), `ap_payment` (after supplier payment via `pay` endpoint)
- **Phase 2 — Notification Center page:** `/notifications` full-page route. 6 category summary cards (All / Security / Action Required / Approvals & Overrides / Operations / Finance) with total + unread counts. Filterable notification list with severity badges (critical/warning/info). Expandable discount rows show: product, orig price, sold price, discount %, capital, repeat-offender badge ("X discounts this week by cashier"). Expandable AP payment rows show: PO#, vendor, amount, fund source, remaining balance. Bell click navigates to full page (no more dropdown). Backend `create_notification()` helper with auto-assigned category + severity. Category counts returned on every GET `/notifications` call.


### Pay Supplier Page — QB-Style Redesign (Complete — Mar 2026)
- **Layout:** Mirrors AR PaymentsPage exactly — left panel (always-visible supplier list with total balance + overdue badges) + right QB-style form
- **Supplier selection:** Click in left panel OR type in "Pay To" search field with dropdown suggestions
- **Smart allocation:** Payment Amount field auto-allocates budget to POs oldest-due-first; checking PO applies unused budget; unchecking returns amount to pool; unused budget shown in header notice + summary
- **Pay All Due:** Checks only overdue POs; **Pay All:** Checks all POs with full balances
- **QB-style footer:** "Amounts for Selected POs" — POs Selected / Total Owed / Applying / Unused Budget / Remaining Balance
- **Method icons removed:** `Pay From` fund source (Cashier / Safe / Check·Bank / Digital) is the single source of truth. `payMethod` auto-derived from fund source for audit trail.
- **All previous AP features preserved:** PIN required, bank/digital lock icons, batch upload modal, collection receipt toggle, shared receipt provenance



### Terminal Token Auto-Refresh (Complete — Mar 2026)
- `POST /api/terminal/refresh-token` endpoint issues a new 24h JWT for active terminal sessions
- Frontend auto-refreshes every 12 hours via `setInterval` in TerminalShell
- On initial load, also refreshes to recover from near-expired tokens
- If token is fully expired (401), auto-logs out and prompts re-pair
- Token stored in localStorage via `onSessionUpdate` callback to TerminalPage

### QR Actions Terminal-Only Gating (Complete — Mar 2026)
- **Backend:** `_verify_terminal_session(terminal_id)` check added to `release_stocks`, `receive_payment`, `transfer_receive` endpoints in `qr_actions.py`
- **Frontend:** Action panels (StockReleaseManager, ReceivePaymentPanel, TransferReceivePanel) gated behind `isTerminal` check in DocViewerPage
- Non-terminal visitors see "Actions require an AgriSmart Terminal" banner
- Document viewing (read-only info, details, attached files) remains open to all
- Receipt/DR uploads remain unrestricted
- `terminal_id` passed from localStorage session through component props to API calls

### Terminal Android Back Button Fix (Complete — Mar 2026)
- Intercepts Android hardware back button / browser back navigation via `popstate` event
- Smart priority chain: close overlays (QR scanner → doc upload → settings → quick scan → doc search → mode menu) → return to Sales tab → double-tap to exit
- Pushes history state entries to prevent PWA from exiting on first back press
- "Press back again to exit" toast with 2-second window (native Android pattern)

### Super Admin Org Context Fix (Complete — Mar 2026)
- **Root cause:** When super admin (org_context=None) performs tenant operations, DB writes omit `organization_id`, making records invisible to regular users
- **Central fix:** `ensure_org_context()` helper resolves org from branch_id. Added to `log_movement()` (catches ALL movement types), plus `branch_transfers.py` (create/send/receive/accept), `sales.py`, `purchase_orders.py`
- **Data repair:** `POST /api/branch-transfers/admin/fix-orphaned-movements` — scans all tenant collections for missing org_id and resolves from branch
- **Live site fix:** 4 orphaned movements, 2 capital_changes, 16 notifications, 1 incident_ticket repaired

### Branch Transfer Invoice Number Display (Complete — Mar 2026)
- Transfer cards in list view now show `invoice_number` badge next to BTO number
- Transfer detail dialog title also shows invoice number

### Movement History Pagination (Complete — Mar 2026)
- Backend `GET /products/{id}/movements` now returns `total` count
- Frontend shows "Showing X of Y movements" counter with "Load More" button

---

### Security Alert Notification Enrichment — Phases 1-3 (Complete — Mar 2026)
- **Phase 1 — Authenticated PIN alerts:** `_raise_security_alert()` now resolves `branch_name` from DB, enriches `user_role` and `user_email`. Message format: `"Test Manager (Manager) entered wrong PIN 6x at Branch 1 — Transaction Verification: Verify PO-XXX"`
- **Phase 2 — QR Terminal alerts:** `_raise_qr_security_alert()` accepts `terminal_id`, resolves to `"AgriSmart Terminal at Branch X"` from `terminal_sessions`. Enriches with `doc_id`, `doc_number`, `counterparty`, `doc_amount` via doc_codes + invoice/PO/transfer lookup. `qr_actions.py` passes `terminal_id` at all 3 terminal-only call sites.
- **Phase 3 — Frontend SecurityAlertDetail:** Expandable two-card layout — WHO+WHAT (authenticated) / TERMINAL+DOCUMENT (QR). Clickable doc number opens existing `ReviewDetailDialog` (same pattern as dashboard widgets). Lock banner for documents locked after 10 failures.


- APScheduler daily job at 8:30 AM: `_daily_compliance_check` in `main.py`
- Fires `compliance_deadline` notifications for:
  - Expired docs (critical severity) — dedup per doc per day
  - Expiring within 30 days (warning severity) — dedup per doc's valid_until date
  - Missing monthly filings after the 15th (SSS, PhilHealth, Pag-IBIG, BIR 1601-C, 0619-E, 2550M) — dedup per month
- `create_notification()` now accepts `severity_override` param for per-call severity
- Frontend: `compliance_deadline` TYPE_CONFIG with orange `FileWarning` icon + `ComplianceDetail` expandable row
- `NOTIFICATION_META` updated with `compliance_deadline` → category: action, severity: warning

## Next Up (P0 — Immediate)
See `/app/memory/ROADMAP.md` for full spec on each item.

### P0 — Compliance Calendar Widget on Dashboard
